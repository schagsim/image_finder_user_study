This document will describe the plan how to incrementally build this software (Image finder - user study).
It is supposed to mimic an agile approach to project developments.

---User---
1) As a user, I want to be able to go through basic flow of the user study
    - Start at "home page"
    - Be navigated to the page where an image is presented
    - Be navigated to the page where the image gallery is presented (part of the image gallery is a button "not present")
    - After clicking either the "not present" button or any image, I want to be redirected to the final page.
    - On the final page, I want to see some basic info (how long it took, whether I did find the image)
    - I will always be brought to home page after clicking the "Image finder" link

2) As a user, I want to view info about the web at "About" page
3) As a user, I want to be able to read Privacy notes about which data the image finder collects about me

---Researcher---
1) As a researcher, I want to collect users' session data to see whether the user has found the presented image
    - Create Session holder class which will collect users' sessions
    - To these sessions, save presented image ID
    - To these sessions, save on what the user clicked (ID or "not-present")
    - Serialize the sessions to json and save it locally after the user selects their image
        - This serialization will contain
            1) Whether the user found the presented image (boolean)
            2) Presented image ID
            3) Selected image ID (or "not-present" string in case the user thinks the image is not present in the gallery)
        - The serialization output might be a subset of what is collected in the actual session.
            - Create another object with only the fields that actually interest the researcher

2) As a researcher, I want to able to review how long it had taken the user to answer (click on something in the gallery).
    - Will be in the session output
    - Will have to be collected in the session
