This document will describe the plan how to incrementally build this software (Image finder - user study).
It is supposed to mimic an agile approach to project developments.

1) As a user, I want to be able to go through basic flow of the user study
    - Start at "home page"
    - Be navigated to the page where an image is presented
    - Be navigated to the page where the image gallery is presented (part of the image gallery is a button "not present")
    - After clicking either the "not present" button or any image, I want to be redirected to the final page.
    - I will always be brought to home page after clicking the "Image finder" link

2) As a user, I want to view info about the web at "About" page
3) As a user, I want to be able to read Privacy notes about which data the image finder collects about me
